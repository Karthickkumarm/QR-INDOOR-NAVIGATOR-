# QR-INDOOR-NAVIGATOR

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- In highly crowded areas such as malls, tourists spots, hotspot local areas,.. Etc there’s a high chance of breakout for infections. 
- If a person wants to go to a particular place where he can’t ask every people he comes across for directions. 
- It is also hard to navigate the places indoor due to the limitations of GPS navigation 
system (i.e. accuracy is very poor and it is also impossible to occur GPS signals in the remote ares).
- Create an android app to navigate the throughout the travel from source to destination.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
* Our model can give highly accurate location in Indoor radius
* Our app can also gives a path which can be navigated using Augmented Reality
* We can use the QR Markers instead of Bluetooth Beacons
* QR Code is a 2D code that contains the location information which provide a better navigation inside the building
